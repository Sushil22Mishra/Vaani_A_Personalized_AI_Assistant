Hi 
I am Vaani
 and here is a quick look at the tech behind me 
I use TensorFlow for understanding and generating responses
the pyttsx3 module handles our voice interactions so I can listen and speak 
React helps me deliver a dynamic user interface 
Bot UI and Converse j s enhance our chat with interactive elements and realtime communication 
These technologies work together to make our interactions smooth and efficient
If you have any questions or need help just ask
